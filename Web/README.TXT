Getting Started
---------------

This SceneGraph is a technology layer that provides a SceneGraph interface as
an abstraction layer from the Fabric Engine plugin. The Scene Graph provides
the building blocks for 3d applications.

The SceneGraph, because it was built on the multi-threaded dependency graph
that Fabric Engine provides, is a very high performance multithreaed scene graph.

Please visit the Fabric Engine demos to see examples of the Scene Graph in action.
